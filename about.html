      <p>
        I am an aspiring front-end developer with a strong foundation in human
        resources and a passion for technology. My experience in leadership
        roles has equipped me with exceptional skills in strategic planning,
        team collaboration, and results-driven decision-making. I enjoy tackling
        complex challenges and find great satisfaction in developing innovative
        solutions.
        <br />
        I have successfully guided diverse teams in achieving their goals while
        fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment. As I transition
        into front-end development, I am committed to leveraging my analytical
        and creative skills to create engaging digital experiences. I believe in
        the power of collaboration and strive to motivate those around me.
        <br />
        I have been actively enhancing my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, and I am eager to apply my knowledge to build user-friendly
        websites and applications. My bilingual communication abilities in
        English and Portuguese, coupled with my cultural awareness, enable me to
        connect with a diverse range of stakeholders. I aim to bridge gaps and
        foster understanding in every interaction.
        <br />
        I am excited to combine my HR expertise with my technical skills to
        contribute to impactful projects in the tech industry. My goal is to
        create environments where users feel valued and understood, and I am
        dedicated to continuously learning and growing in my new career path.
        The journey ahead is full of opportunities, and I am ready to embrace
        them!

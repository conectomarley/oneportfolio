        Aspiring Front-End Developer
        <br />
        Iam an aspiring front-end developer with a strong foundation in human
        resources and a passion for technology. My experience in leadership
        roles has equipped me with exceptional skills in strategic planning,
        team collaboration, and results-driven decision-making. I have
        successfully guided diverse teams in achieving their goals while
        fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment. As I transition
        into front-end development, I am committed to leveraging my analytical
        and creative skills to create engaging digital experiences. I have been
        actively enhancing my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am
        eager to apply my knowledge to build user-friendly websites and
        applications. My bilingual communication abilities in English and
        Portuguese, coupled with my cultural awareness, enable me to connect
        with a diverse range of stakeholders. I am excited to combine my HR
        expertise with my technical skills to contribute to impactful projects
        in the tech industry.
